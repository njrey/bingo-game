### TODO

1. Change rendering?
   - Experiment with a board that is just one unit instead of 5 rows of 5
1. Board array tuple type
   - Use TS to make our board array limited to 25 items
   - Tuple types may work: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52489261/typescript-can-i-define-an-n-length-tuple-type
1. Testing
   - Jest?
   - Testing Library?
1. Handle long inputs for square text
   - char limit?
1. Circle for 'occupied' state
1. Calculate winner
1. Inputs to create board
   - tile by tile?
   - ~~list of 25 items pasted into a textbox~~
1. Board setup input error
   - If board length != 25
   - popup modal says "Board is x tiles long, add/subtract y from input list
1. Randomizer
   - Figure out how to randomly assign board
   - shuffle array, then slice each next element
1. Styling
   - Tailwind CSS?
   - Dark mode
1. Types
   - Actually use types for props and state
   - Make my own types
1. React Hooks
   - Can I use that?
