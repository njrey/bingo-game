### TODO

1. Where I left off

   - Board Setup V2
   - Tile-By-Tile editing
   - Also: text area for mass edit
   - Tile-By-Tile updates text area and vice versa
   - Validation: Char limit for tile
   - Edit button with icon starts "Edit Mode"
   - Click again to turn off "Edit Mode"

1. iPad Css
   - somewhere between a large screen and a phone, add a mediaquery for ipads
1. Board array tuple type
   - Use TS to make our board array limited to 25 items
   - Tuple types may work: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52489261/typescript-can-i-define-an-n-length-tuple-type
1. Handle long inputs for square text
   - char limit?
1. Circle for 'occupied' state
1. Calculate winner
1. Inputs to create board
   - tile by tile?
   - "generate board" button
1. Board setup input error
   - If board length != 25
   - Use popup modal says "Board is x tiles long, add/subtract y from input list instead of alert
1. Styling
   - Tailwind CSS?
   - Dark mode
1. Have a 'board setup state' and a 'play the game state'
   - We don't need both on the screen at the same time
1. Make it look better with styling, theme and animations
   - maybe even add some color
